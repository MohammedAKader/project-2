This project is aimed at creating a complete voting system that tallies up votes, counts and decides the winner.
If the program quits before the vote ends, it is able to retrieve the last state of the vote when it restarts.
First, the user enters the username. Then the user enters the password. If the username and password are correct,
the user can login to the system. The user can vote in the system, change his/her vote or change his/her password.
When the result of the voting is obvious, the voting ends, and the winner is determined.
